### How to Play

Spray Play is a two player game in which you try to knock objects into each your opponent's goal area using your nifty pellet cannon.

The controls are simple: just press your finger on your side of the screen in the direction you'd like to spray your pellets.

If you successfully send that object into your opponent's area, you collect it as a trophy -- a gleeful memory of your opponent's shame.

### Where to get the game
