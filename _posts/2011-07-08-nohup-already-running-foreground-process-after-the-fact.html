<p>So you've been running a script for 8 hours that takes 3 days to run. And it's 5pm on a Friday. And your flight leaves in 30 minutes. And the bomb timer goes off in 15 seconds.</p>
<p>And your script's process is in the foreground. And you neglected to run it in screen.</p>
<p style="">[[posterous-content:DgrphgtpyrvquJIlnBAh]]</p>
<p>You know there's a way to background a process in the foreground (ctrl+z), and a way to nohup a process when you start it so you can log off while it runs (nohup ./program &amp;).</p>
<p>But nohup only works when you first start a process. How do you "nohup" an already running process after the fact?</p>
<p>This maneuver may save your life (or at least your process):</p>

<p>Then it's pi&ntilde;a coladas for you, root!</p>
