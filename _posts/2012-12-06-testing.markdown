This is pretty neat. Github has a new [file creation and editing tool](https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github).

Now creating and editing [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) / [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) / JekyllBootstrap posts can be done online. Just log in to GitHub, navigate to your *.github.com/_posts folder, and create or edit a post!
