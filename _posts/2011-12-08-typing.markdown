# Modeling Human Keyboarding

For my final project in Tufts' [course in computational modeling](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150CM/timetable.html), I decided to build a model of keyboard typing.

To collect data to verify the model's accuracy, I built a web-based tool to track keypresses and their timings. I went a little overboard and ended up with a pretty full-fledged typing trainer.

# Getting the Task Framework Done Fast (and fun!)

For the front-end of the keyboarding task, I used Javascript. Having just completed the HTML5 game jam in which I made [Rave Game](http://bcjordan.github.com/games/rave-thru-dawn/), Javascript was fresh on my mind. That, and something browser-based would be easiest to load on anyone's laptop during presentation time. 

I ended up using portions of JQuery for display changes, the Twitter bootstrap framework for UI elements and HighCharts for graphing. [It's on GitHub](http://github.com/bcjordan/keytask).

# Building the Model

In building the model, I decided to focus on a tiny subset of the transcription typing phenomena noted in [Wu and Liu 2008](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yililiu/Wu-Liu-TOCHI-typing-2008.pdf). I ended up with a neural network model that closely matches the source data for a number of the criterion. 

# Play with it!

I think the coolest part of this project has to be the experience of typing and seeing your data points appear on the graph right below your input box. Give it a shot!
