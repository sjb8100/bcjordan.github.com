<p>If you are having trouble installing therubyracer on Mac OS X Lion 10.7, getting an error message like:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>ld: library not found for -lv8
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [v8.bundle] Error 1
rake aborted!
Command failed with status (2): [make...]</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Try installing v8 from brew first:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>brew install v8
sudo gem install libv8
sudo gem install therubyracer</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Let me know if that works for you. This issue should be resolved in the next release of therubyracer.</p>
