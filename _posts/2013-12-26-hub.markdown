# Install Hub

```
brew install hub
```

# Create Repository

```
hub create ruby-bits
```

## Protocol issue and workaround

Getting the error:

```
brian:rails brian$ hub create ruby-bits
github.com username: bcjordan
github.com password for bcjordan (never stored): 
Updating origin
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
error: Could not fetch origin
```

The fix was to set the hub protocol to always use https instead of git:

```bash
git config --global hub.protocol https
```
